## Gameplay & Mechanics
The main gameplay is based on the passage of never-ending exciting adventures on behalf of the protagonist, traveling through worlds, defeating enemies of varying strength and in search of worthwhile rewards. The main action takes place in two main fantasy worlds: space and the world of dragons, from which also changes the main type of movement, atmosphere and enemies. On the hero's way there are various enemies, dangerous obstacles, as well as portals that can take you to a completely different world, where new unexplored adventures will begin...

***The game provides a wide set of varied mechanics :***
- The player can control the character in a variety of ways using the primary movements, like moves forward, backward and sideways, power boosts, which allows for increased speed, and the ability to shoot when the player finds an enemy in path.
- The main character has a health reserve mechanic of 3 lives, losing all of them will end the game, though lost chances can be regained.
T- he mechanics of enemies that appear algorithmically in different parts of the map, have the ability to attack, damaging the protagonist, but if they take a certain amount of damage, they die;
- Periodically on the map appear various objects such as meteorites, black holes and lasers, causing damage when it hits.
- Also, special mechanics are available for objects such as portals, which periodically appear on the map and allow the player to drift into another world, continuing the adventure there.

## Art & Dynamic Gameplay Development
We took great pride in developing all the game’s art entirely from scratch, ensuring a unique and immersive visual experience. Our team created over 100 individual art assets and meticulously designed 20 different animations, including two full sets of player animations for movement and attacks. Every detail was carefully crafted, down to the player’s firing animation, which adds to the fluidity and realism of the combat experience. Our commitment to quality extended beyond static visuals, as we animated enemy behaviors, environmental effects, and world transitions to create a truly dynamic and engaging atmosphere.

On the development side, we implemented an intelligent spawning algorithm that dynamically adjusts the game's difficulty based on the player's score and survival time. This ensures a balanced experience where the challenge gradually increases, keeping players engaged without feeling overwhelmed. The algorithm manages the frequency and strength of enemies, obstacle appearances, and portal activations, making every session feel fresh and rewarding. This combination of detailed artwork and smart game mechanics results in a thrilling and ever-evolving adventure.

## Testing & Iterative Balancing

To ensure a smooth and engaging gameplay experience, we conducted extensive testing throughout the development process. Our team followed an iterative approach, continuously refining mechanics, fixing bugs, and balancing the difficulty to provide a fair yet challenging experience.

We performed playtesting sessions, identifying and resolving issues related to enemy spawning, movement responsiveness, collision detection, and world transitions. Bugs were systematically debugged using Unity’s debugging tools, log tracking, and frame analysis to pinpoint performance bottlenecks and unexpected behaviors.

In addition, we carefully fine-tuned our dynamic difficulty adjustment algorithm. By analyzing player performance across multiple test runs, we optimized enemy spawn rates, environmental hazards, and power-up distributions to maintain a balanced progression. Our goal was to ensure that both casual and experienced players could enjoy a challenging but fair adventure.
